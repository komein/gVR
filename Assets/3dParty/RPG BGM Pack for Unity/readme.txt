Thank you for downloading this contents, RPG BGM Pack for Unity Zero.

Some tracks include introductions, and folder of that includes 3 files.

track name(full)
track name(intro)
track name(main)

Full version is for people who use plugins and set loop marker. Others are for people who use delayfunction.
You can use only main file and it is no problem.(However you may feel something wrong because of reverberation.)
For more information about delay time and loop point, please read "delaytime.txt" .


/////////////////Abobut SampleScene/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

SampleScene.unity is for sound demo and demo of playing music with introduction, using delay function.
However, this scene has some trouble,

・Using of audioSource.Pause() while playing introduction file deviate the timing of playing main file.
 
・Timing of playing main file is slightly deviated occasionally.

so please take notice of it.
